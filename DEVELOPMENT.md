# Development

## Build and test

Run unit tests:

    jest
    
Build all (format, build, pack, test):

    npm run all

## Running a workflow locally

If you want to run the e2e tests locally to try out the action, install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act).

You can then run all workflows like this:

    ./run-workflows.sh

Typically, if you just want to try out the action, it's sufficient to run a single e2e test like this:

    npm run build && npm run pack && act -j test-e2e-specific-apps

This will execute the test-e2e-specific-apps job, which runs the action configured to install a couple of apps (ytt and kbld).

Note: remember to run `build` and `pack` first, as the workflow will act upon the `dist/index.js` file.

## Submitting PRs

Before submitting a PR, you need to:

1. Format your code.
2. Update `dist/index.js`.

You can do this with `npm run all`.

If you forget, the `check build up to date` build step will fail.

## Releasing

1. Publish a release to the Marketplace with a semver name, e.g. `v1.2.3`. (Note: the `v` prefix is important, as are the minor and patch versions. `1.2.3` and `v1.2` aren't valid if you want the automated workflow in #2 to do its thing.)
2. If this is the latest release per semver naming then the [release workflow](https://github.com/carvel-dev/setup-action/actions?query=workflow%3Arelease) will automatically update the major tag for the release (e.g. if you release v1.2.3 it will update the `v1` tag to point to the same commit as `v1.2.3`).
